## Our project proposal got accepted!  

Hi there,  

We had the present our Student Bot Network proposal to 2 members of staff who have never seen it before.  
And we are glad to announce that it got accepted with some very helpful feedback from the 2 staff members, to say we are over the moon is an understatement as we have put in a decent amount of work thus far and didn't want it to go to waste.  
We have a prototype of a main function nearly complete and getting our PaaS service up and running ready to start developing our first bot using the main function.  
Conor and myself are delighted and are now 100% committed to provide, what we think, will be a hugely beneficial service to every student on across all DCU campuses.  

Ben and Conor.
