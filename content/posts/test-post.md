## Our project in a nutshell

Hi there,  
  
Conor and myself are really excited about this project and what it will become, so let me describe what our idea is.  
With a rise in different college/university course groups moving away from Facebook pages to grouped messesging services like Messenger, Whatsapp, Slack etc. Having to exit said app and go to another resource to find things like timetable information is both time consuming and annoying.  
Our solution will look to solve this issue by creating a network of chat bots for various messaging services to keep daily/regularly needed information close to hand. By also using translation services and text-to-speech services we can make the bots usable by everyone.  
We are really looking forward to getting started and delivering a quality network of useful bots.

Ben and Conor.
