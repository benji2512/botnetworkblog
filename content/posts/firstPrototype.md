## Our project proposal got accepted!  

Hi there,  

We did it! A working prototype for the Facebook Messenger Platform.  
We wanted to get this done before we leave DCU for Christmas and start studying 24/7 for our January exams and we achived it, not without some head banging and plenty of lines of code written and deleted, I must say.  
Our user-PaaS-FaaS workflow works pretty well, some speed optimisation will be done but as a work PoC we are delighted with it.  

Until next time,

Ben and Conor.
