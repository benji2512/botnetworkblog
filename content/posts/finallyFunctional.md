## We are finally functional

Hi there,

It's been a while since we have wrote here but so much has changed.  
We have gone from having a messenger prototype to have a fully functional messenger bot AND a fully functional discord bot. While we still are adding some extra functionality, the core features and functions are available to use on both platforms. The Natural Language Processing aspect of the bots, at this stage, is quite good. While not perfect it recognises all the questions of varying length and various languages accurately. It is an easy process to improve the recogition so all that is needed there is to keep asking the bots questions in different ways.  
What is left for us now is to add 2 more functions, A function for real-time bus times leaving DCU stops and a function to show if a room is currently free or not, and write testing pipelines for the testing portion of our project.  
All in all, we are in a good place leading into the last 2 weeks before the deadline of March 6th.  
  
Until next time,  
Ben and Conor
