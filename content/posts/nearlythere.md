# We are nearly finished  
  
Hi there,  
  
So it is nearly time to submit, 53 hours to be precise, and the nerves are starting to kick in. We are really glad to have all our functions finished and working as described in the bots 'help()' function. It really takes the pressure off significantly.  
What we have left to do now is the documentation that is required, this is a video walkthrough of our bots, a user manual, a technical specification document and this blog. All these documents are graded along with the demo we have to do this coming Tuesday.  
Over all we feel we are in a good place so close to the finish line and are excited to demo it and get good feedback from the lecturers.  
  
Ben and Conor.
